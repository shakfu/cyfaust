# Continuous Integration Experiments

This folder contains some notes on continuous integration experiments.

## cibuildwheel

This section contains the following shelfed files which were related to supporting [cibuildwheel](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

- cyfaust-cibuildwheel.yml

- pyproject.toml

Without a linux machine with docker installed, testing `cibuildwheel` becomes a huge pain, especially c onsidering the difference between `manylinux` variants.

This may be revisited again at a later point.
